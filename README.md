# Data Science Projects

This repository contains several projects related to Data Science. In these projects, we have used several popular Python libraries such as Scikit-Learn, pandas, NumPy, seaborn, and Matplotlib, among others. Below is a list of ten more Python libraries that are commonly used in Data Science:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- PyTorch
- NLTK
- Statsmodels
- Scrapy
- BeautifulSoup
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost

## Classification Algorithms

In the Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects of this repository, we have used several algorithms for classification. Here is a list of ten popular classification algorithms with links to learn more about them:
